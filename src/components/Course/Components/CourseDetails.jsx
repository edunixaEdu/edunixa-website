        To perform specific tasks on a computer program, you need to store and
        retrieve the data to perform computations. A data structure in this case
        is such a named location that could be used to store and organize this
        data.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the same way, algorithms allow you to solve a set of problems.
        Learning these data structures and algorithms allows you to write
        efficient computer programs that can be implemented on various programs
        and apps.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our DSA training program is going to introduce you to different types of
        data structures and algorithms to finally implement them in Python, C,
        C++, and Java.
        <br />
        <br />
        Assignments - Our training program consists of a variety of assignments
        that slowly test your learning and expose you to real-world problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        Instructors - Handpicked by the best, our instructors have been deployed
        to assist and counsel every student whenever needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Learning methods - Live classes and recorded videos, everything crafted
        to match your preferences.
        <br />
        <br />
        Certificates - Provided at the end of every training program, authorized
        by some of the best learning institutions.
